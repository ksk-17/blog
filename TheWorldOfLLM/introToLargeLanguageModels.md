# Intro to Large Language Models

## What is LLM

LLM stands for "Large Language Model," which uses deep learning algorithms to analyze massive amounts of text data, allowing it to understand complex language patterns and generate human-like text, translate languages, answer questions, and perform other natural language processing tasks effectively; essentially, it works by learning the relationships between words and phrases from a vast dataset, enabling it to predict and generate relevant text based on context.

## Architecture behind LLM

LLMs are build upon transformer model, which was first introduced in the following paper [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762).

Refer to [Transformer Architecture](https://github.com/ksk-17/blog/blob/master/TheWorldOfLLM/transformer.md), for summary of the paper.

The most influential LLM architecture was GPT by OpenAI published in the following paper [Improving Language Understanding
